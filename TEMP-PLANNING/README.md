# ⚠️ TEMPORARY PLANNING DOCUMENTATION ⚠️

## 🚨 IMPORTANT - DO NOT COMMIT TO MAIN BRANCH 🚨

This directory contains **TEMPORARY** working documents for analysis and planning.

**Before merging to main:**
- Archive or delete these files
- Create proper GitHub issues from the analysis
- Move any keeper documentation to appropriate locations

---

## Purpose

These documents are for:
- 📝 In-depth problem analysis before creating GitHub issues
- 🎯 Feature planning and design discussions
- 🔍 Code review findings and technical decisions
- 💭 Collaborative planning on feature branches

---

## File Naming Convention

- **`issue-XX-description.md`**: Problem analysis and bug documentation
- **`feat-XX-description.md`**: Feature proposals and design documents
- **`fix-XX-description.md`**: Minimal fixes and quick patches

---

## Current Documents

### Issues
- **issue-01-webserver-ip-detection-linux.md**: Web server local IP detection fails on Linux/Raspberry Pi platforms
- **issue-02-autopirate-bugs.md**: AutoPirate has critical hardcoded position bug + multiple other issues

### Features
(None yet)

### Fixes
(None yet)

---

## Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Find problem or plan feature
2. **Document**: Create detailed analysis document here (issue-XX.md, feat-XX.md, etc.)
3. **Discuss**: Use these docs to discuss approach and solutions
4. **Implement**: Code the solution on feature branch
5. **GitHub Issue**: Create proper issue from analysis when ready
6. **Clean Up**: Archive/delete temp docs before merging to main

---

## Notes

- ✅ Safe to commit on feature branches for collaboration
- ✅ Safe to reference in PR discussions
- ❌ Should NOT be merged to main branch
- ❌ Not for end-user documentation (use main README.md or wiki)
- 🗑️ Delete or archive after implementation complete

Think of this as a **whiteboard** or **scratch pad** - useful during work, cleaned up when done.
